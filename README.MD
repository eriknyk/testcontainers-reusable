> Testing application during development should be something that is not disturbing our work, but supporting it. Having a clear distinction between fast unit tests, and complex, but slower integration tests is a good start for achieving quick feedback loop. The faster we will get a result of most relevant test, the quicker we can implement new features without breaking the application logic.

This project shows, how to configure and use Reusable Testcontainers feature, which significantly reduce container startup time.
